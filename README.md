### Program Languages/Environment:
This entire assignment is written in C. ( gcc Compiler 9.3 is recommended for compilation )

### IDE Used: Visual Studio Code

## Program execution:
### In Visual studio Code : 
--> Created a C project in VS Code \n
--> Source functions were written in src file
--> To compile: I used make command in VS Code terminal which takes care of compiling all the src files
--> To run: use .exe file to run (./main.exe in my case)

### In Ubuntu terminal :
--> Create a folder to save all the .c .h files
--> cd <folder>
--> To compile: gcc -o main main.c lllifo.c lllifo.h cbfifo.c cbfifo.h test_lllifo.c test_lllifo.h test_cbfifo.c test_cbfifo.h -Wall -Werror
--> To run: ./main
